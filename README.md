## Introduction
Through the default settings of Venmo we were able to find information about people that should be kept private. By open-sourcing our research we hope to show people the dangers of keeping your data public.

## Research
Our given dataset came from [this](https://github.com/sa7mon/venmo-data) Venmo database. By sorting the data and searching for certain keywords we have narrowed down the list to filtered selections of buyers, sellers and the service(s) provided in the transaction.
