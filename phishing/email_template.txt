Subject: Does your Mother Know?

To: <email@email.com>

Hello, I hope this finds you well! I know you, <facebook link> <venmo username>
<First and Last Name>. I know that finding this email might be disconcerting,
but do not fret! Feet, I mean, c'mon we all have them, they get us from point A
to B, but some of us, such as yourself are more interested in them than others.
You wouldn't like your friends, family or employer to know your kink. Take your
privacy seriously.

We have found you through the public data exposed by your usage and settings in
Venmo. How can you fix this?
1. Turn privacy settings to PRIVATE
2. Take your privacy seriously, make sure to always choose this option when
given.

Feet, I mean, c'mon, we all have them, they get us from point A to B, but some
of us like them a bit more than others. Especially, you, we know, you have been
in the habit of purchasing feet pictures <Date and time of purchase> from
<Actor: Name of seller>. We also know that you're family members would be quite
interested in knowing how obsessed you are with the sole-love of feet. Your <add
family member linked from fb>.

How can you stop the embarrasment of your kink being exposed to the one's that
love you the most? I feel that, 0.5BTC seems like a reasonable amount,
I have attached a BitCoin address to be paid to, with a generous grace peroid of
24h of the recieval of the BitCoin.
