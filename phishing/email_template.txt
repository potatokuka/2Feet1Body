Subject: Does your Mother Know?

To: <email@email.com>

Hello, I hope this finds you well! I know you, <Facebook Link> <Venmo Username>
<First and Last Name>. I know that finding this email might be disconcerting,
but do not fret! We know you purchased on <Date and Time> from <Seller Username>.
Feet, I mean, c'mon we all have them, they get us from point A to B,
but some of us, such as yourself are more interested in them than others.
You wouldn't like your friends, family or employer to know your kink. Take your
privacy seriously.

We have found you through the public data exposed by your usage and settings in
Venmo. How can you fix this?
1. Turn privacy settings to PRIVATE
2. Take your privacy seriously, make sure to always choose this option when
given.
