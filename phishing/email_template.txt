Hello, I hope this finds you well! I know you, <facebook link> <venmo username>
<First and Last Name>. I know that finding this email might be disconcerting,
but do not fret! 

Feet, I mean, c'mon, we all have them, they get us from point A to B, but some
of us like them a bit more than others. Especially, you, we know, you have been
in the habit of purchasing feet pictures <Date and time of purchase> from
<Actor: Name of seller>. We also know that you're family members would be quite
interested in knowing how obsessed you are with the sole-love of feet. Your <add
family member linked from fb>.

How can you stop the embarrasment of your kink being exposed to the one's that
love you the most? I feel that, 0.5BTC seems like a reasonable amount,
I have attached a BitCoin address to be paid to, with a generous grace peroid of
24h of the recieval of the BitCoin.
